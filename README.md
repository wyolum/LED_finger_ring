# LED Finger Ring

- Uses 300 mm long flexible "rope/string" type LED
- The 3D printed ring has an inner diameter of 19 mm / 0.748"
- Inner circumference is 59.66 mm / 2.35"
- US / Canada ring size 9

You can use either 1632 or 2032 coin cell if you make the battery holder from 1 mm dia brass wire as I've done (see /photos folder).

If you use SMD type battery holder, then 1632 size would probably be the right size to use. The holder for 2032 battery may be too big.
