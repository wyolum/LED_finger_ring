# LED Finger Ring

My friend Kevin sent me a couple of flexible LED strings, so I designed a pair of finger rings for my wife. It's a great party conversation starter. The design is based on a 300 mm long flexible "rope/string" type LED. The 3D printed ring has an inner diameter of 19 mm (0.748"), which is close to US / Canada ring size 9. Inner circumference is 59.66 mm (2.35").

- Uses 300 mm long flexible "rope/string" type LED
- The 3D printed ring has an inner diameter of 19 mm / 0.748"
- Inner circumference is 59.66 mm / 2.35"
- US / Canada ring size 9
- You can use either 1632 or 2032 coin cell if you make the battery holder from 1 mm dia brass wire as I've done (see /photos folder).
- If you use SMD type battery holder, then 1632 size would probably be the right size to use. The holder for 2032 battery may be too big.

## How I Designed This
Designed in FreeCAD. I've kept the pitch a bit wide to spread out the helical coil.
